# SCUBA's Nextcloud-snap Wiki

I'm neither a Linux crack nor a full time admin... 

My day job is software support for a leading WMS. I was introduced to Linux and became an Ubuntu and FOSS user.

For self-hosted Nextcloud I turned to [Nextcloud-snap](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap). There's a great community behind it and support is fantastic.

It's difficult to remember everything learned. Taking notes helps. Sharing notes is "[wiki](https://github.com/scubamuc/scubas_nextcloud-snap-wiki/wiki)".

**This is a personal [wiki](https://github.com/scubamuc/scubas_nextcloud-snap-wiki/wiki) containing helpful notes and scripts for self hosting Nextcloud server**

Some entries are in German. You may translate as you please. If I can help, let me know...
